# Python Encryption Toolkit

## Project Overview
The **Python Encryption Toolkit** is a lightweight library for encoding, decoding, and testing simple encryption mechanisms in Python. This toolkit is ideal for anyone interested in learning more about encryption techniques and binary-encoding methods in Python. It includes functions for binary-to-decimal conversions, basic encryption algorithms, and automated testing scripts.

## Files in This Project

- **bindec.py**: This module provides functions for binary-to-decimal (and vice versa) conversions, facilitating data handling in binary format.
- **encryption.py**: This module implements encryption and decryption functions, including custom algorithms designed for educational purposes.
- **tester.py**: A script containing test cases to validate the functionality of the `bindec` and `encryption` modules, ensuring the toolkit's reliability.

## Features
- Basic encryption and decryption functions
- Binary to decimal and decimal to binary conversions
- Automated testing with a focus on encryption validation

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
